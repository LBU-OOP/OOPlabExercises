This week you are going to undertake some simple development work which should allow you to become familiar with the Eclipse IDE.

Complete the following exercises by first working through the “Introduction to Eclipse IDE.ppt” power point presentation.  Start the Eclipse IDE from the launcher application within the labs.
Programming Projects:

Create a new project called “HelloWorld” and write a simple Java program that displays the message “Hello World” to the console.

Close the output console window (by pressing the [x] icon at the top right of the console window), then make it reappear by using the appropriate menu option.

Enter, compile and run the following application

public class Test
{
   //----------------------------------------------------
   //  Prints a statement.
   //----------------------------------------------------
   public static void main (String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println ("An Emergency Broadcast");
   }
}

Introduce the following errors, one at a time. Note any messages that the compiler produces. Fix the previous error each time. If no error messages are produced, be prepared to explain why.

Change Test to test
Change Emergency to emergency.
Remove the first quotation mark in the string.
Change main to man
Change println to bogus
Remove the semicolon at the end of the println statement
Remove the last brace in the program

Create a second project called “PersonalDetails” and write a program that outputs some personal details to the screen, e.g. Name, Address, Age, Phone number etc.

Write and application that prints the following diamond shape. Don’t print any unneeded characters

       *
      ***
     *****
	  *******
     *****
      ***
       *


If you complete the exercises above answer the following questions.
 
a) What is the latest version of the Java SDK that is available?
b) What is the difference between Java SE and Java ME?
c) Which operating system is Java available for?
d) What is the most popular IDE available for Java apart from Eclipse?
e) What is the main() function for in a Java program?
